- Created 6 Firebase hooks: useFirebaseStatus, useFirebaseGate, useFirebaseDoor, useFirebaseSeat, useFirebaseLights, useFirebaseMp3
- Completely rewrote control-dashboard.tsx with new structure: ESP32 status card (online/lastSeen), gate control (toggle), door control (toggle), seat control (activate/reset), 6-zone lights with relay logic (inverted for street/ship), MP3 player (play/stop/next/prev/track select), real-time notifications for state changes

- ESP32 communication works via Firebase Realtime Database at /wedding_hall/* paths
- Relay logic correctly handles inverted (LOW=ON) for street/ship lights and normal (HIGH=ON) for ceiling/floor/pillars
- All device controls (gate, door, seat, 6 lights, MP3) have real-time state sync
- Toast notifications fire on ESP32 state changes (connection, gate, door, seat activation)
- Admin can test Firebase connection and reset all devices from Settings page

### Work Task
Update core permission system files with new role-based access structure across 6 files.

### Work Summary
Updated the permission system across 6 files to implement a refined role-based access control:

1. **src/lib/auth.ts** - Replaced ROLE_PERMISSIONS with new granular permissions: dashboard, control, calendar, activity, notifications permissions added; employee no longer has payments:read or settings:read; viewer restricted to dashboard:read, customers:read, bookings:read, calendar:read, notifications:read only.

2. **src/components/permission-banner.tsx** - Replaced PERMISSIONS_TABLE with 10 resource entries (dashboard, control, customers, bookings, payments, calendar, activity, notifications, users, settings). Added ROLE_BANNER config mapping each role to a label/icon/color (admin=gold ShieldCheck "تحكم كامل", manager=cyan ShieldCheck "إدارة كاملة", employee=slate Info "إدخال بيانات", viewer=emerald Eye "عرض فقط"). Updated PermissionsCard to display role banner at top.

3. **src/app/page.tsx** - Updated NAV_ITEMS with new role arrays matching permission structure. Added "profile" nav item (accessible to all roles) before settings. Added useEffect to redirect users to their first accessible page when current page is unauthorized.

4. **src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts** - Changed permission check from `control:read` to `dashboard:read`.

5. **src/app/api/activity/route.ts** - Changed permission check from `control:write` to `activity:read`.

6. **src/app/api/notifications/route.ts** - Changed GET permission from `control:read` to `notifications:read`, PUT permission from `control:read` to `notifications:write`.

All lint checks pass, dev server compiles without errors.

## Task ID: 4
### Work Task
Update all component files with proper role-based permissions and fix English text.

### Work Summary
Updated 11 component files with role-based permission checks and verified all user-visible text is in Arabic:

1. **dashboard-page.tsx** - Added ShieldAlert + ReadOnlyBanner imports, DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ROLES check (admin/manager/viewer). Employee gets "غير مصرح" unauthorized screen. Viewer sees ReadOnlyBanner. Permission check placed after all React hooks to comply with rules-of-hooks.

2. **control-dashboard.tsx** - Added ShieldAlert import. Viewer now sees "غير مصرح" unauthorized screen (device cards hidden via conditional fragment). Admin/manager/employee retain full control. The ReadOnlyBanner for non-control non-viewer roles preserved.

3. **customer-management.tsx** - Already correctly implemented: viewer sees ReadOnlyBanner, employee sees PartialPermissionBanner (no delete), admin/manager have full CRUD. No changes needed.

4. **booking-management.tsx** - Already correctly implemented: same pattern as customer-management. No changes needed.

5. **billing-management.tsx** - Added ShieldAlert import. Added BILLING_ALLOWED_ROLES check (admin/manager only). Employee and viewer now see "غير مصرح" unauthorized screen. Check placed after all hooks.

6. **calendar-view.tsx** - Added ShieldAlert import. Added CALENDAR_ALLOWED_ROLES check (admin/manager/viewer). Employee sees "غير مصرح". Viewer sees ReadOnlyBanner (changed from bookings-based permission to direct role check). Check placed after all hooks.

7. **activity-log-page.tsx** - Already correctly implemented: non-admin/manager get unauthorized screen. No changes needed.

8. **notification-bell.tsx** - Already correctly implemented: all roles can view and mark as read. No changes needed.

9. **settings-panel.tsx** - Employee and viewer now see "غير مصرح" unauthorized screen. Manager sees ReadOnlyBanner ("وضع العرض فقط"). Admin retains full access. Check placed after all hooks.

10. **user-management.tsx** - Already correctly implemented: admin-only access with unauthorized screen. No changes needed.

11. **profile-page.tsx** - Already correctly implemented: all roles can access. All text already in Arabic. No changes needed.

All user-visible text was verified to be in Arabic — no English text was found in any component JSX. All lint checks pass (0 errors), dev server compiles successfully.
