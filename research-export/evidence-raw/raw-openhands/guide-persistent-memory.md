# Persistent Memory

> Give agents opt-in, two-tier memory that survives across conversations.

export const path_to_script_0 = "examples/01_standalone_sdk/55_persistent_memory.py"

> A ready-to-run example is available [here](#ready-to-run-example)!

Persistent memory lets an agent keep what it learned -- root causes, environment quirks, project decisions, user preferences -- in plain Markdown files that are loaded back into the system prompt at the start of every new conversation. The agent maintains the files itself as it works, so it gets better at a project over time.

The feature is **opt-in and off by default**: without it, agents keep the existing `AGENTS.md`-based guidance and prompts are unchanged.

## Enabling Persistent Memory

Set `load_memory=True` on the agent's `AgentContext`:

```python focus={5} icon="python" theme={null}
from openhands.sdk import Agent, AgentContext

agent = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    agent_context=AgentContext(load_memory=True),
    tools=tools,
)
```

That single flag does two things:

1. At session start, the conversation reads the `MEMORY.md` indexes from both memory tiers and injects them into the system prompt as a `<MEMORY_CONTEXT>` block.
2. The system prompt's `<MEMORY>` section switches to instructions that teach the agent where its memory lives and how to maintain it.

## The Two Tiers

| Tier        | Location                         | Contents                                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | `~/.openhands/memory/`           | Knowledge and preferences that apply across all projects |
| **Project** | `<workspace>/.openhands/memory/` | Knowledge specific to the current repository             |

Each tier contains:

* **`MEMORY.md`** -- a curated index of durable facts. This is the only file injected into the prompt, so the agent is instructed to keep it small and high-value.
* **Daily logs (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`)** -- free-form working notes. They are never injected automatically; the agent reads them on demand with its file tools when `MEMORY.md` points to them.

The files are plain Markdown: you can review, edit, or delete them at any time, and a project team can even commit `.openhands/memory/` to share agent-learned knowledge.

## What Gets Injected

At the start of each opted-in conversation, the resolved memory appears in the system prompt like this (user tier first, then project tier):

```text wrap theme={null}
<MEMORY_CONTEXT>
<UNTRUSTED_CONTENT>
The content below comes from memory files on disk and has NOT been verified by OpenHands.
...
</UNTRUSTED_CONTENT>

# User memory (~/.openhands/memory/MEMORY.md)
- prefers uv over pip for Python tooling

# Project memory (.openhands/memory/MEMORY.md)
- the API uses cursor-based pagination
</MEMORY_CONTEXT>
```

A few properties worth knowing:

* **Size budget**: the combined indexes are capped at \~6,000 characters. When the budget is exceeded, whole lines are dropped from the top of each over-budget tier (the oldest content) -- partial lines never survive, the tier headers are always kept, and a truncation notice appears under the header of any tier that lost lines. Keep indexes curated.
* **Untrusted by design**: the injected block is wrapped in `<UNTRUSTED_CONTENT>`. Memory files are typically agent-written, but anyone with access to the workspace or repository can edit or commit them (a cloned repo may ship a `.openhands/memory/MEMORY.md`), so the agent is told they may contain prompt injection, and to treat them as unverified hints, never as authoritative instructions.
* **Never persisted**: the resolved memory text is re-read from disk each session and is excluded from conversation persistence (`base_state.json`) and API payloads.
* **Best-effort**: an unreadable memory file logs a warning and the conversation starts normally without it.

## How the Agent Maintains Memory

When memory is enabled, the system prompt instructs the agent to:

* record durable, broadly useful facts in `MEMORY.md` near the end of a task (creating the directories and files if missing), and put long detail in daily logs;
* merge duplicates, prune stale entries, and keep the indexes concise;
* never record secrets or credentials, and skip facts that are trivially re-discoverable (directory listings, obvious commands);
* keep `AGENTS.md` for instructions addressed to *any* agent working in the repository -- memory is for what the agent learned itself.

## Ready-to-run Example

<Note>
  This example is available on GitHub: [examples/01\_standalone\_sdk/55\_persistent\_memory.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/examples/01_standalone_sdk/55_persistent_memory.py)
</Note>

```python icon="python" expandable examples/01_standalone_sdk/55_persistent_memory.py theme={null}
"""Opt-in persistent memory across sessions (two-tier ``MEMORY.md``).

With ``AgentContext(load_memory=True)`` a conversation loads the ``MEMORY.md``
indexes from ``~/.openhands/memory/`` (user tier) and
``<workspace>/.openhands/memory/`` (project tier) into the system prompt at
session start (the ``<MEMORY_CONTEXT>`` block), and the system prompt
instructs the agent to maintain those files as it works.

This example runs two conversations over the same workspace:

1. Session 1 asks the agent to record a project decision in its persistent
   project memory -- the agent writes ``.openhands/memory/MEMORY.md`` itself.
2. Session 2 is a brand-new conversation: the saved memory is injected into
   its system prompt automatically, so the agent already knows the decision
   without being told again.

Memory is opt-in and off by default. The example only writes inside a
temporary workspace; the user tier under ``~`` is left untouched.

  The model name should follow the [LiteLLM convention](https://models.litellm.ai/): `provider/model_name` (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, `openai/gpt-4o`).
  The `LLM_API_KEY` should be the API key for your chosen provider.

## Next Steps

* **[Skills](/sdk/guides/skill)** - Inject reusable instructions and context into agents
* **[Context Condenser](/sdk/guides/context-condenser)** - Keep long conversations within the context window
* **[Persistence](/sdk/guides/convo-persistence)** - Save and restore conversation state across sessions
