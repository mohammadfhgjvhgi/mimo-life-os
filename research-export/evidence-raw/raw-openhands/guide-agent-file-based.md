# File-Based Agents

> Define specialized sub-agents as simple Markdown files with YAML frontmatter — no Python code required.

export const path_to_script_0 = "examples/01_standalone_sdk/42_file_based_subagents.py"

> A ready-to-run example is available [here](#ready-to-run-example)!

File-based agents let you define specialized sub-agents using Markdown files. Each file declares the agent's name, description, tools, and system prompt — the same things you'd pass to `register_agent()` in code, but without writing any Python.

This is the fastest way to create reusable, domain-specific agents that can be invoked via [delegation](/sdk/guides/task-tool-set).

## Agent File Format

An agent is a single `.md` file with YAML frontmatter and a Markdown body:

```markdown icon="markdown" theme={null}
---
name: code-reviewer
description: >
  Reviews code for quality, bugs, and best practices.
  <example>Review this pull request for issues</example>
  <example>Check this code for bugs</example>
tools:
  - file_editor
  - terminal
model: inherit
---

# Code Reviewer

You are a meticulous code reviewer. When reviewing code:

1. **Correctness** - Look for bugs, off-by-one errors, and race conditions.
2. **Style** - Check for consistent naming and idiomatic usage.
3. **Performance** - Identify unnecessary allocations or algorithmic issues.
4. **Security** - Flag injection vulnerabilities or hardcoded secrets.

Keep feedback concise and actionable. For each issue, suggest a fix.
```

The YAML frontmatter configures the agent. The Markdown body becomes the agent's system prompt.

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field                   | Required | Default     | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `model`                 | No       | `"inherit"` | LLM model profile to load and use for the subagent (`"inherit"` uses the parent agent's model)                                                                                |
| `skills`                | No       | `[]`        | List of skill names for this agent (see [Skill Loading Precedence](/overview/skills#skill-loading-precedence) for resolution order).                                          |
| `max_iteration_per_run` | No       | `None`      | Maximum iterations per run. Must be strictly positive, or `None` for the default value.                                                                                       |
| `color`                 | No       | `None`      | [Rich color name](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendix/colors.html) (e.g., `"blue"`, `"green"`) used by visualizers to style this agent's output in terminal panels |
| `mcp_servers`           | No       | `None`      | MCP server configurations for this agent (see [MCP Servers](#mcp-servers))                                                                                                    |
| `hooks`                 | No       | `None`      | Hook configuration for lifecycle events (see [Hooks](#hooks))                                                                                                                 |
| `permission_mode`       | No       | `None`      | Controls how the subagent handles action confirmations (see [Permission Mode](#permission-mode))                                                                              |

### `<example>` Tags

Add `<example>` tags inside the description to help the orchestrating agent know **when** to delegate to this agent:

```markdown icon="markdown" theme={null}
description: >
  Writes and improves technical documentation.
  <example>Write docs for this module</example>
  <example>Improve the README</example>
```

These examples are extracted and stored as `when_to_use_examples` on the `AgentDefinition` object. They can be used by routing logic (or prompt-building) to help decide when to delegate to the right sub-agent.

## Directory Conventions

Place agent files in these directories, scanned in **priority order** (first match wins):

| Priority | Location                           | Scope                     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1        | `{project}/.agents/agents/*.md`    | Project-level (primary)   |
| 2        | `{project}/.openhands/agents/*.md` | Project-level (secondary) |
| 3        | `~/.agents/agents/*.md`            | User-level (primary)      |
| 4        | `~/.openhands/agents/*.md`         | User-level (secondary)    |

<Tree>
  <Tree.Folder name="my-project/" defaultOpen>
    <Tree.Folder name=".agents" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.Folder name="agents" defaultOpen>
        <Tree.File name="code-reviewer.md" />

        <Tree.File name="tech-writer.md" />

        <Tree.File name="security-auditor.md" />
      </Tree.Folder>
    </Tree.Folder>

    <Tree.File name="src/" />

    <Tree.File name="..." />
  </Tree.Folder>
</Tree>

**Rules:**

* Only top-level `.md` files are loaded (subdirectories are skipped)
* `README.md` files are automatically skipped
* Project-level agents take priority over user-level agents with the same name

<Tip>
  Put agents shared across all your projects in `~/.agents/agents/`. Put project-specific agents in `{project}/.agents/agents/`.
</Tip>

## Built-in Agents

The `openhands-tools` package ships with built-in sub-agents as Markdown files in `openhands/tools/preset/subagents/`.
They can be registered via `register_builtins_agents()` and become available for delegation tasks.

By default, all agents include `finish` tool and the `think` tool.

### Available Built-in Sub-Agents

| Agent               | Tools                                        | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **general-purpose** | `terminal`, `file_editor`, `task_tracker`    | General-purpose agent for tasks requiring a combination of capabilities. Used as the fallback when no agent name is specified.                |
| **code-explorer**   | `terminal`                                   | Read-only codebase exploration agent. Finds files, searches code, reads source — never creates or modifies anything.                          |
| **bash-runner**     | `terminal`                                   | Command execution specialist. Runs shell commands, builds, tests, linters, and git operations. Returns concise reports instead of raw output. |
| **web-researcher**  | `browser_tool_set` + MCP (`fetch`, `tavily`) | Web research specialist. Searches the web, navigates documentation, and extracts information from URLs.                                       |

When `enable_browser=False`, browser-dependent agents like `web-researcher` are not registered.

<Note>
  **Deprecated names:** The following legacy names are deprecated (since v1.12.0) and will be removed in version 2.0.0:

  * `default` → use `general-purpose`
  * `default cli mode` → use `general-purpose`
  * `explore` → use `code-explorer`
  * `bash` → use `bash-runner`
</Note>

### Registering Built-in Sub-Agents

Call `register_builtins_agents()` to register all built-in sub-agents. This is typically done once before creating a conversation:

```python icon="python" focus={3-4, 6-7} theme={null}
from openhands.tools.preset.default import register_builtins_agents

# Register all built-in sub-agents (including web-researcher)
register_builtins_agents()

# Or without browser-dependent agents (excludes web-researcher)
register_builtins_agents(enable_browser=False)
```

<Warning>
  Registration order is critical when programmatically registering agents that share a name with a built-in agent. The system is designed to skip registration if a name is already taken. Therefore, if you register your custom agents before the built-in agents are loaded, your custom versions will take precedence.

  Conversely, if the built-in agents are loaded first, they will take precedence, and any subsequent registration of a custom agent with the same name will be ignored.
</Warning>

## Overall Priority

When the same agent name is defined in multiple places, the highest-priority source wins. Registration is first-come first-win.

| Priority    | Source                              | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 (highest) | **Programmatic** `register_agent()` | Registered first, never overwritten                   |
| 2           | **Plugin agents** (`Plugin.agents`) | Loaded from plugin `agents/` directories              |
| 3           | **Project-level** file-based agents | `.agents/agents/*.md` or `.openhands/agents/*.md`     |
| 4 (lowest)  | **User-level** file-based agents    | `~/.agents/agents/*.md` or `~/.openhands/agents/*.md` |

## Auto-Registration

The simplest way to use file-based agents is auto-registration. Call `register_file_agents()` with your project directory, and all discovered agents are registered into the delegation system:

```python icon="python" focus={3} theme={null}
from openhands.sdk.subagent import register_file_agents

agent_names = register_file_agents("/path/to/project")
print(f"Registered {len(agent_names)} agents: {agent_names}")
```

This scans both project-level and user-level directories, deduplicates by name, and registers each agent as a delegate that can be spawned by the orchestrator.

## Manual Loading

For more control, load and register agents explicitly:

```python icon="python" focus={3-6, 8-14} theme={null}
from pathlib import Path

from openhands.sdk import load_agents_from_dir, register_agent, agent_definition_to_factory

# Load from a specific directory
agents_dir = Path("agents")
agent_definitions = load_agents_from_dir(agents_dir)

# Register each agent
for agent_def in agent_definitions:
    register_agent(
        name=agent_def.name,
        factory_func=agent_definition_to_factory(agent_def),
        description=agent_def.description,
    )
```

### Key Functions

#### `load_agents_from_dir()`

Scans a directory for `.md` files and returns a list of `AgentDefinition` objects:

```python icon="python" focus={3-4} theme={null}
from pathlib import Path

from openhands.sdk import load_agents_from_dir

definitions = load_agents_from_dir(Path(".agents/agents"))
for d in definitions:
    print(f"{d.name}: {d.tools}, model={d.model}")
```

#### `agent_definition_to_factory()`

Converts an `AgentDefinition` into a factory function `(LLM) -> Agent`:

```python icon="python" theme={null}
from openhands.sdk import agent_definition_to_factory

factory = agent_definition_to_factory(agent_def)
# The factory is called by the delegation system with the parent's LLM
```

The factory:

* Maps tool names from the frontmatter to `Tool` objects
* Appends the Markdown body to the parent system message via `AgentContext(system_message_suffix=...)`
* Respects the `model` field (`"inherit"` keeps the parent LLM; an explicit model name creates a copy)

#### `load_project_agents()` / `load_user_agents()`

Load agents from project-level or user-level directories respectively:

```python icon="python" focus={3, 4} theme={null}
from openhands.sdk.subagent import load_project_agents, load_user_agents

project_agents = load_project_agents("/path/to/project")
user_agents = load_user_agents()  # scans ~/.agents/agents/ and ~/.openhands/agents/
```

## Using with Delegation

File-based agents are designed to work with the [`TaskToolSet`](/sdk/guides/task-tool-set). Once registered, the orchestrating agent can delegate tasks to them by name through the task tool's `subagent_type` parameter:

```python icon="python" focus={6, 9-12, 14-18} theme={null}
from openhands.sdk import Agent, Conversation, Tool
from openhands.sdk.subagent import register_file_agents
from openhands.tools.delegate import DelegationVisualizer
from openhands.tools.task import TaskToolSet

register_file_agents("/path/to/project")  # Register .agents/agents/*.md

# Set up the orchestrator with the task tool
main_agent = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=[Tool(name=TaskToolSet.name)],
)

conversation = Conversation(
    agent=main_agent,
    workspace="/path/to/project",
    visualizer=DelegationVisualizer(name="Orchestrator"),
)
```

To learn more about agent delegation, follow our [comprehensive guide](/sdk/guides/task-tool-set).

## Example Agent Files

### Code Reviewer

```markdown icon="markdown" theme={null}
---
name: code-reviewer
description: >
  Reviews code for quality, bugs, and best practices.
  <example>Review this pull request for issues</example>
  <example>Check this code for bugs</example>
tools:
  - file_editor
  - terminal
---

# Code Reviewer

You are a meticulous code reviewer. When reviewing code:

1. **Correctness** - Look for bugs, off-by-one errors, null pointer issues, and race conditions.
2. **Style** - Check for consistent naming, formatting, and idiomatic usage.
3. **Performance** - Identify unnecessary allocations, N+1 queries, or algorithmic inefficiencies.
4. **Security** - Flag potential injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or unsafe deserialization.

Keep feedback concise and actionable. For each issue found, suggest a concrete fix.
```

### Technical Writer

```markdown icon="markdown" theme={null}
---
name: tech-writer
description: >
  Writes and improves technical documentation.
  <example>Write docs for this module</example>
  <example>Improve the README</example>
tools:
  - file_editor
---

# Technical Writer

You are a skilled technical writer. When creating or improving documentation:

1. **Audience** - Write for developers who are new to the project.
2. **Structure** - Use clear headings, code examples, and step-by-step instructions.
3. **Accuracy** - Read the source code before documenting behavior. Never guess.
4. **Brevity** - Prefer short, concrete sentences over long explanations.

Always include a usage example with expected output when documenting functions or APIs.
```

## Advanced Features

### MCP Servers

File-based agents can define [MCP server configurations](/sdk/guides/mcp) inline, giving them access to external tools without any Python code:

```markdown icon="markdown" theme={null}
---
name: web-researcher
description: Researches topics using web fetching capabilities.
tools:
  - file_editor
mcp_servers:
  fetch:
    command: uvx
    args:
      - mcp-server-fetch
  filesystem:
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
---

You are a web researcher with access to fetch and filesystem tools.
Use the fetch tool to retrieve web content and save findings to files.
```

The `mcp_servers` field uses the same format as the [MCP configuration](/sdk/guides/mcp) — each key is a server name, and the value contains `command` and `args` for launching the server.

#### Environment Variable Resolution

All string values in MCP server configurations support `${VAR}` (and `$VAR`) environment variable references, which are resolved from `os.environ` at load time. This lets you forward secrets and dynamic paths without hard-coding them in Markdown:

```markdown icon="markdown" theme={null}
---
name: api-agent
description: Agent with MCP server using environment-based secrets.
mcp_servers:
  my-server:
    command: ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/server
    args:
      - --config
      - ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json
    env:
      API_KEY: ${MY_API_KEY}
  remote:
    type: http
    url: ${API_BASE}/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}
---

An agent that connects to MCP servers configured via environment variables.
```

Environment variable resolution applies recursively to all string fields — `command`, `args`, `url`, `headers`, `env`, and any other string values in the server config. If a referenced variable is not set, the placeholder is left unchanged (e.g., `${NONEXISTENT_VAR}` stays as-is).

### Hooks

File-based agents can define [lifecycle hooks](/sdk/guides/hooks) that run at specific points during execution:

```markdown icon="markdown" theme={null}
---
name: audited-agent
description: An agent with audit logging hooks.
tools:
  - terminal
  - file_editor
hooks:
  pre_tool_use:
    - matcher: "terminal"
      hooks:
        - command: "./scripts/validate_command.sh"
          timeout: 10
  post_tool_use:
    - matcher: "*"
      hooks:
        - command: "./scripts/log_tool_usage.sh"
          timeout: 5
---

You are an audited agent. All your actions are logged for compliance.
```

**Hook event types:**

* `pre_tool_use` — Runs before tool execution (can block with exit code 2)
* `post_tool_use` — Runs after tool execution
* `user_prompt_submit` — Runs before processing user messages
* `session_start` / `session_end` — Run when conversation starts/ends
* `stop` — Runs when agent tries to finish (can block)

Each hook matcher supports:

* `"*"` — Matches all tools
* Exact name — e.g., `"terminal"` matches only that tool
* Regex patterns — e.g., `"/file_.*/"` matches tools starting with `file_`

For more details on hooks, see the [Hooks guide](/sdk/guides/hooks).

### Permission Mode

Control how a file-based agent handles action confirmations with the `permission_mode` field:

```markdown icon="markdown" theme={null}
---
name: autonomous-agent
description: Runs without requiring user confirmation.
tools:
  - terminal
  - file_editor
permission_mode: never_confirm
---

You are an autonomous agent that executes tasks without manual approval.
```

**Available modes:**

| Mode             | Behavior                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `always_confirm` | Requires user approval for **all** actions                                                                       |
| `never_confirm`  | Executes all actions without approval                                                                            |
| `confirm_risky`  | Only requires approval for actions above a risk threshold (requires a [security analyzer](/sdk/guides/security)) |

When `permission_mode` is omitted (or set to `None`), the subagent inherits the confirmation policy from its parent conversation.

<Note>
  Permission mode is particularly useful for specialized sub-agents. For example, a "read-only explorer" agent might use `never_confirm` since it only reads files, while a "deploy" agent might use `always_confirm` for safety.
</Note>

For more details on security and confirmation policies, see the [Security guide](/sdk/guides/security).

## Agents in Plugins

> Plugins bundle agents, tools, skills, and MCP servers into reusable packages.
> Learn more about plugins [here](/sdk/guides/plugins).

File-based agents can also be bundled inside plugins. Place them in the `agents/` directory of your plugin:

<Tree>
  <Tree.Folder name="my-plugin/" defaultOpen>
    <Tree.Folder name=".plugin" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.File name="plugin.json" />
    </Tree.Folder>

    <Tree.Folder name="agents" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.File name="code-reviewer.md" />

      <Tree.File name="tech-writer.md" />
    </Tree.Folder>
  </Tree.Folder>
</Tree>

Plugin agents use the same `.md` format and are registered automatically when the plugin is loaded. They have higher priority than file-based agents but lower than programmatic `register_agent()` calls.

## Ready-to-run Example

<Note>
  This example is available on GitHub: [examples/01\_standalone\_sdk/42\_file\_based\_subagents.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/examples/01_standalone_sdk/42_file_based_subagents.py)
</Note>

This example uses `AgentDefinition` directly. File-based agents are loaded into the same `AgentDefinition` objects (from Markdown) and registered the same way.

```python icon="python" expandable examples/01_standalone_sdk/42_file_based_subagents.py theme={null}

<Note>
  The model name should follow the [LiteLLM convention](https://models.litellm.ai/): `provider/model_name` (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, `openai/gpt-4o`).
  The `LLM_API_KEY` should be the API key for your chosen provider.
