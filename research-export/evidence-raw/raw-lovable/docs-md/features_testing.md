# Test and verify your app

> Lovable provides browser testing, frontend tests, and edge function verification to help understand system behavior, validate user workflows, and ensure backend logic works as expected.

Lovable gives you several ways to check that your application behaves as expected. These tools help you reproduce issues, confirm fixes, and avoid regressions across frontend and backend behavior.

<Tip>
  **Choose the right test**

  If you are not sure which testing tool to use, start with the kind of behavior you want to verify.

  * If the issue is visible to users, use browser testing.
  * If UI behavior should stay correct over time, use frontend tests.
  * If the issue is in backend logic, call the edge function directly, then add an edge test.
</Tip>

## What Lovable can observe during verification

Lovable collects information when the agent runs verification tools. This information is gathered automatically as part of those tools and is used to understand what is happening in your app.

Lovable can capture:

* browser console logs during browser testing
* network requests made during browser testing
* test failures and build errors from test runs
* request and response data when calling backend functions directly

These signals are available whenever the relevant tools are used and are often enough to diagnose issues without additional manual debugging.

Lovable supports several testing approaches, each designed for a different kind of verification. Most tests fall into one of two categories:

* checking complete user flows
* checking specific rules or behaviors in isolation

## Browser testing

[Browser testing](/features/browser-testing) checks real user behavior by interacting with your app in a browser. The agent can navigate pages, click buttons, fill forms, and submit requests. While doing so, it can capture screenshots, inspect UI elements, and observe console and network activity.

Use browser testing when:

* someone reports broken or unexpected UI behavior
* you need to check a multi-step flow such as onboarding or checkout
* the issue may depend on routing, authentication, timing, or state
* you want to confirm changes from a user’s point of view

Browser testing is slower than other methods, but it gives the clearest picture of what a user actually experiences.

Browser testing may be started by the agent during investigation. You can also request it explicitly.

**Example**

```text wrap theme={null}
Use browser testing to verify the checkout flow.
```

## Frontend tests

Frontend tests verify UI behavior in isolation using clear assertions. They are useful for ensuring that specific UI logic continues to work as expected over time.

Frontend tests run in a simulated browser environment, run quickly and give consistent results, and usually live next to components as `.test.tsx` files.

**Test stack**

* Vitest
* React Testing Library
* jsdom

Use frontend tests when:

* the issue can be described as a clear rule or expectation
* you are fixing a UI regression and want to prevent it from coming back
* you are working with conditional rendering or complex state such as forms, tables, and filters
* you want fast feedback without running the full app

Frontend tests run only when requested.

**Example**

```text wrap theme={null}
Write and run frontend tests for the login form.
```

## Backend verification with edge functions

Lovable provides two complementary ways to verify backend behavior in edge functions: direct calls and automated tests. These approaches are often used together.

### Direct edge function calls

Direct calls let the agent run an edge function with specific inputs and inspect the result immediately. This avoids UI-related complexity and is useful for quick isolation. If you are logged in, authenticated calls can use your current session.

Use direct calls when:

* you suspect a backend issue and want to separate it from the UI
* you need to check specific parameters or inputs
* you want to compare behavior before and after a change
* you are debugging authenticated behavior

Direct edge function calls run only when requested.

**Example**

```text wrap theme={null}
Call the signup edge function directly with an invalid email.
```

### Edge tests

Edge tests are automated tests that check backend rules over time. They help ensure that important logic does not break silently.

**Test stack**

* Deno built-in test runner
* Native TypeScript support

Use edge tests when:

* you change an edge function and want regression protection
* you are validating business rules or permissions
* the issue is subtle and hard to verify manually

Edge tests run only when requested.

**Example**

```text wrap theme={null}
Write edge tests for the payment processing function.
```

### How backend verification tools work together

Direct calls and edge tests are often used together when debugging backend behavior.

A common sequence looks like this:

1. Call the edge function directly to reproduce the issue with a specific input.
2. Apply the fix once the behavior is understood.
3. Call the function again with the same input to confirm the change.
4. Add an edge test to ensure the behavior does not regress over time.

This approach keeps iteration fast while still providing long-term verification.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to run all tests for every change?">
    No. Most issues can be understood and verified using a single tool. Browser testing is useful for user-visible problems, frontend tests help lock down specific UI behavior, and backend verification is best for business logic. Choose the tool that matches the type of issue you are investigating.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What should I do if an issue does not resolve after a few attempts?">
    When an issue does not resolve after a few attempts, you can ask Lovable to use multiple verification tools. Lovable runs these tools and uses their output to guide the next step.

    * Reviewing logs or test failures from earlier runs often helps narrow down the cause.
    * Backend issues are usually easiest to isolate by calling the edge function directly.
    * User-facing issues are best explored with browser testing.
    * Once the behavior is understood, adding automated tests helps keep it stable over time.

    If the issue still does not resolve, revert to the latest stable version.

  <Accordion title="Does Lovable run verification tools automatically?">
    Most verification tools run only when you ask for them. In some cases, the agent may suggest or initiate a tool during investigation, but verification does not run silently in the background.
