<Tip>
  **Choose a mode**

  Lovable has two modes:

  * [**Plan mode**](/features/plan-mode) → think through the problem, explore options, and decide on an approach
  * **Build mode** → implement changes and verify the outcome

  Plan mode is for decision-making. Build mode is for execution.

  The two modes are designed to work together, and you can switch between them at any time.
</Tip>

## Overview

Build mode (previously Agent mode) is Lovable’s autonomous execution mode, designed to implement changes directly in your project.

When you give Lovable a task, it takes ownership of execution end to end. It understands your intent, explores the codebase for context, applies changes across files, and resolves issues that appear during development. While it works, you can see progress through visible tasks and review the results before moving on.

## What Build mode is for

You can use Build mode to:

* Implement features or changes once an approach is decided
* Fix bugs or errors end to end
* Refactor code across multiple files
* Apply coordinated changes across frontend, backend, and configuration
* Debug issues that arise during implementation
* Inspect logs and network activity to identify problems
* Fetch external documentation or assets when needed
* Generate or edit images and videos for use in your project
* Verify results before finishing

All changes are applied directly to your project and surfaced through file diffs and summaries. You can follow along step by step in the **Details view**.

## How to use Build mode

Build mode is active unless you switch to [Plan mode](/features/plan-mode).

To use it, describe what you want and send your message. Clear requirements and constraints help Lovable produce better results.

**Be specific about what you want**

```text wrap theme={null}
Add a contact form with name, email, and message fields. Validate email format and show error messages inline.
```

**Describe expected behavior**

```text wrap theme={null}
When users click ‘Add to Cart’, show a success message and update the cart count in the header. Store cart items in local storage.
```

**Provide context for complex changes**

```text wrap theme={null}
Update the dashboard to show sales data from the last 30 days. Use the existing Chart component and match the styling used on the analytics page.
```

**Set guardrails for sensitive areas**

```text wrap theme={null}
Add a new feature to @src/pages/dashboard. Do not modify @src/shared/Layout.tsx or the existing authentication logic.
```

## Tasks and execution visibility

While Lovable is working, tasks appear in the chat interface showing:

* Current step being executed
* Files being modified
* Tools being used (search, web fetch, image generation)
* Progress through multi-step implementations

This visibility helps you:

* Follow progress on complex builds
* Understand the steps being performed
* Stay oriented during complex changes
* Spot issues early if something seems off

## Prompt queue

Lovable **processes one task at a time**. While Lovable is working, you can continue sending prompts and they will be added to a visible queue above the chat input.

* Pause and resume the entire queue as needed
* Reorder, edit, copy, or remove individual queued prompts
* Repeat a queued prompt a specified number of times (up to 50)

This makes it easier to batch work, collaborate without waiting, and automate repetitive workflows.

## Debugging and verification

When using Build mode, Lovable does more than ensure code compiles.

As part of investigation and problem solving, the agent can:

* observe build errors and failures from test runs
* inspect console output and network requests when verification tools are used
* reproduce reported issues using browser testing or targeted backend calls
* verify that fixes work as expected by running appropriate checks

Lovable has access to verification tools such as browser testing, frontend tests, and edge function verification to help understand system behavior, validate user workflows, and ensure backend logic works as expected. Most of these tools run only when you ask for them.

For a detailed explanation of testing and verification capabilities, see [Test and verify your app](/features/testing).

## Pricing

Pricing for Build mode is **usage-based**. Cost depends on factors such as:

* Number of files modified
* Complexity of logic changes
* Amount of codebase exploration required
* Use of tools such as verification, browser checks, web search, or image generation

Many requests cost less than one credit, while more complex tasks may cost more. You can view the cost of a message from the three-dot menu on that message. See [Credits and usage](/introduction/credits-and-usage) for more information.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Lovable modify my project directly when in Build mode?">
    Yes. Lovable applies changes directly to your project when using Build mode. All modifications are visible through file diffs and summaries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if errors occur during implementation?">
    Lovable can inspect logs, runtime output, and network activity and iterate on fixes until the issue is resolved or clarified. See [Test and verify your app](/features/testing) for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see what Lovable is doing while it works?">
    Yes. Visible tasks show each step of execution, including progress and which files are being modified.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can multiple messages be sent while working in Build mode?">
    Yes. Additional messages are queued and processed in order. You can reorder, pause, or remove queued messages at any time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I stop a request, and what happens when I do?">
    Click the **stop button** while Lovable is responding to immediately halt the current task. This lets you stop a request to provide more context or correct the agent.

    Lovable keeps all changes made up to that point, so you won’t lose completed work. Stopped requests are charged based on the work completed so far.

    If you want to remove the changes, use the **undo button** to revert to the previous state.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should I switch to Plan mode?">
    Switch to [Plan mode](/features/plan-mode) when you want to:

    * Think through a complex change before implementation
    * Compare multiple architectural approaches
    * Review or edit a plan before any code is changed
    * Investigate an issue and decide on a solution first
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reference a specific file when chatting with Lovable?">
    Yes. You can reference code files from your current project directly in chat to make edits and discussion faster and more precise.

    Type `@` and select a file, or use the **Reference file in chat** button in the [code editor](/features/code-mode). For example:

    ```wrap theme={null}
    @src/components/UserProfile.tsx add a loading state here
    ```

    This only references files within your current project. To reference another project, see [Cross-project referencing](/features/cross-project-referencing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Lovable reuse code or features from another project?">
    Yes. Lovable supports [cross-project referencing](/features/cross-project-referencing) within the same workspace.

    You can use `@` mentions to reference another project directly, or simply ask Lovable to reuse an existing implementation. The agent can access relevant code, files, assets, and chat history from other projects and adapt them to your current one.

    Cross-project access is read-only and respects workspace permissions.
