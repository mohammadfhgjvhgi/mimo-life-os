# Workspace analytics

Track adoption, credit consumption, and usage patterns across your workspace from **Admin > Analytics**. Only workspace admins can access this page.

Use the time range selector at the top right of the page to scope every chart and table on the dashboard to the last **7, 14, 30, or 90 days** (30 by default). "Active users" refers to members who interacted with Dust during the selected window.

## What's on the dashboard

* **Overview**: total workspace members alongside the active-user count for the selected period.

* **Credit usage**: a stacked bar chart of credits consumed over time. Credits are Dust's unit of AI compute usage. Switch the granularity between **Daily, Weekly, and Monthly**, and break the data down by:

  * **Total**: all consumption combined.
  * **By Usage Type**: interactive (User) versus Programmatic (API and integration) usage.
  * **By Agent**, **By User**, or **By Source**: the top contributors in each dimension.

  When grouped, use the **Top N** selector (5, 10, 15, 20, or 30) to control how many series are shown. The rest are bundled into an "Others" bar. Click a legend entry to drill into one or more series, and **Clear filters** to reset. The chart can be opened full screen.

* **Users by credits**: the top 100 members by credits consumed over the selected period, with their message count and most-used agents (model and, on hover, description). Search for a specific user by name.

* **Agents by credits**: the top 100 agents by credits consumed, with their model, description, top users, and top skills (skill descriptions show on hover). Search for a specific agent by name.

* **Activity over time**: a line chart that toggles between **messages and conversations** (volume) and **DAU / WAU / MAU** (daily, weekly, and monthly active users).

* **Message sources**: breakdown of where messages originate, covering the Dust web app, the browser extension, Slack, Teams, email, triggered and scheduled runs, and programmatic integrations such as the API, Zapier, n8n, and Make.

* **Tool usage**: executions and unique users per tool over time. Pick a specific tool from the dropdown to drill in.

* **Skill usage**: executions and unique users per skill, with the same drill-down control.

## Downloading data

**Per-chart CSVs.** The Activity over time, Message sources, Tool usage, and Skill usage charts each have a download button that exports the underlying data as a CSV, scoped to the currently selected time range. Files are named after their section (for example `dust_activity_last_30_days.csv`) so they're easy to archive or feed into another tool.

**Privacy:** analytics and exports never include the content of messages. Only metadata such as timestamps, user and agent identifiers, conversation IDs, credit consumption, and the source of each message is captured.

## Accessing analytics via the API

You can pull usage data programmatically through the [Export workspace analytics](/docs/developer-platform/dust-api-documentation/export-workspace-analytics) endpoint. You must use a **workspace admin API key** to call it.

Pass the `table` you want along with a `startDate` and `endDate` (both `YYYY-MM-DD`):

| Table           | Description                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `usage_metrics` | Daily messages, conversations, and active users                                         |
| `active_users`  | Daily, weekly, and monthly active users                                                 |
| `source`        | Message volume by origin                                                                |
| `tool_usage`    | Tool executions and unique users per day                                                |
| `skills`        | Skill catalog with metadata (name, description, last editor, and timestamps)            |
| `skill_usage`   | Skill executions and unique users per day                                               |
| `agents`        | Top agents by message count                                                             |
| `users`         | Top users by message count                                                              |
| `messages`      | Detailed message-level log (metadata only, no content)                                  |
| `feedback`      | User feedback on agent messages (thumb, optional comment, agent, and conversation link) |

Responses are returned as CSV by default, or as JSON when `format=json`. Pass an optional `timezone` parameter (an IANA name such as `Europe/Paris` or `America/New_York`) to align daily buckets to your local time rather than UTC.

<Danger>
  **Legacy endpoint**

  The previous `workspace-usage` endpoint is deprecated and will be removed after **2026-06-01**. Migrate to `analytics/export` before then.
