## What is a Skill?

A skill is a folder. Inside it lives a file called `SKILL.md` with the instructions Agent follows, plus any supporting files you want it to reference. Skills live in your project's `/.agents/skills` directory and conform to the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) — an open standard that works across agents.

Agent sees the name and description of every installed Skill, but only loads the full content when relevant to the current task. This makes skills context-efficient: you can install many without degrading Agent's output.

## Pre-defined Skills

Replit ships with pre-defined skills available from the **Use a skill** picker in chat and from the new-project starting-point picker. These skills work in every project without installation. For the full catalog, partner skills, and how to install them, see the [Skills directory](/features/agent/skills-directory).

To add a pre-defined skill, open the **Use a skill** picker from the chat input and select a skill, or simply ask Agent to load the skill.

## Skill scope

Skills can be scoped at different levels:

| Scope               | Availability                            | Where it lives                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project-level**   | Specific to one project                 | Versioned with your files in `/.agents/skills`                                                            |
| **Workspace-level** | Available to everyone in your workspace | Managed centrally in Workspace Settings                                                                   |
| **Enterprise**      | Company-wide standards                  | Included in [custom templates](/teams/custom-templates) and [design systems](/teams/custom-design-system) |

For workspace-level skills, see [Agent Customization](/features/agent/agent-customization) to set up workspace skills and custom instructions for your team.

## How Agent loads skills

Agent reads the metadata (name and description) of every installed skill on every chat. The full body of a skill loads only when Agent determines the skill is relevant to the current task. This keeps skill content out of the context window until needed.

Installed skills persist in your project across Agent sessions and can be committed to version control for team sharing.

## Working with other AI coding tools

<Accordion title="Import skills from other AI coding tools">
  If you work across multiple AI coding tools, [rulesync](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync) has Replit support and helps you maintain consistent configurations.

  You can import skills from other AI coding assistants:

  ```bash theme={null}
  npx rulesync init
  npx rulesync import --targets claudecode --features skills
  npx rulesync generate --targets replit --features skills
  ```

  This allows you to maintain a single set of skills that work across different development environments.
